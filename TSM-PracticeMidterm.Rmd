#In this time series plot, I am seeing that there is an increasing trend due to the fact that the line is gradually increasing.

#Based on the five number summary we can see the following:
# MINIMUM VALUE: 23.7210
# MAXIMUM VALUE: 136.0940
# MEDIAN VALUE: 85.8780
# 1ST QUARTILE VALUE: 63.9505
# 3RD QUARTILE VALUE: 108.9770

#Looking at the time series, summary stats, and boxplots you can tell even more that the data is displaying a trend because the numbers are increasing 


stl_decomp <- stl(us_arr, s.window = "periodic")

#Based on the decomp, the time series seems seasonal based on the obvious ups and downs in the seasonal section of the plot.
#The decomposition is multiplicative rather than additive
seasonal_component <- stl_decomp$time.series[, "seasonal"]
seasonal_indices <- tapply(seasonal_component, cycle(us_arr), mean)
#Below are the seasonal indicies
# You can see the highest value is 6.713605 and the lowest value is 4.732221 
print(seasonal_indices)
#The reason behind these values is because it is during the holiday season

seasonallyadj <- seasadj(stl_decomp)

#Seasonality does have big fluctuations, as there are still remaining fluctuations.



#Naive Model

naive_forecast <- naive(us_arr, h=12)

#The plot below indicates that the naive model shoes the trend but not the seasonal patterns
plot(naive_forecast$residuals)

#The histogram below shows that the naive model isnt a bad choice but not the best because of the right skewdness

#Below is the plot for fitted values vs residuals

#Below is the plot for actual values vs residuals

#In this ACF we can see tha the spikes occur at regular intervals meaning there is some seasonality that the naive model did not take into account
